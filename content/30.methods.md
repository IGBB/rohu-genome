### Genome Sequencing & Flowcytometry

ALAM – Rohu blood collection 

#### Flow cytometry 

The genome size of *Labeo rohita* was estimated for five samples via flow cytometry using trout erythrocyte nuclei (TENs; https://www.biosure.com/tens.html) as a standard (genome size=6.5pg).
For each sample, nuclei were stabilized in 200 ul of LB01-propidium iodide (PI) buffer as per (Pellicer & Leitch, 2014), and two drops of TENs standard were used per 50ul of fish blood.
Each sample was measured twice, totaling 10 runs overall. 
Only measurements with greater than 5,000 nuclei and a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 3% were retained (Pellicer & Leitch, 2014).

#### Illumina short-read sequencing

A total of 2 µg of extracted genomic DNA was used for DNA-Seq library preparation using Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). 
The final DNA-Seq library with the insert size range of 350 bp to 450 bp was submitted to Novogene company (www.en.novogene.com) for total of 2 lanes of PE150 Illumina HiSeq X-Ten (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) sequencing.

#### Oxford Nanopore sequencing

For each Nanopore sequencing run, 2 to 2.5 µg of genomic DNA was used in the library preparation with Nanopore Genomic DNA Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK 109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK).
The final library (about 700 to 750 ng) was loaded on a Nanopore Flow Cell R9.4.1 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and sequenced on GridION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) for 48 hours. 
A total of 10 flow cell runs were conducted for the genome assembly.

#### Hi-C sequencing

One hundred µl of fish blood was subjected to the Hi-C library preparation using the Proximo Hi-C Animal Kit (Phase Genomics, Seattle, WA, USA). 
The final DNA-Seq library was submitted to Novogene company (www.en.novogene.com) for 1 lane of PE150 Illumina HiSeq X-Ten (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) sequencing run.

### Assembly & Annotation 

Jellyfish (v2.2.10) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr011] and GenomeScope (v1.0) [@pmcid:PMC5870704] estimated the genome size using the Illumina paried reads digested into 50-mers. 

Nanopore data was filtered to remove the control lambda-phage and sequences shorter the 1000 bases using the nanopack tool suite (v1.0.1) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty149]. 
The filtered data was assembled into contigs using wtdbg2 (v2.4) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0669-3]. 
The contigs were polished using the two iterations of racon (v1.4.0) [@doi:10.1101/gr.214270.116] with minimap2 (v2.17) (@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191) mapping the nanopore reads. 
The contigs were further polished using pilon (v1.23) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112963] with bwa (v0.7.10) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324] mapping the Illumina paired reads. 
The contigs were scaffolded using Bionano Solve ( Solve3.4.1_09262019) [@url:https://bionanogenomics.com/support-page/bionano-access-software/) and SALSA (v2.3) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007273]. 
That scaffolds larger than 10Mb were linked and oriented based on the Onychostoma macrolepis genome [@doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13190], the most similar chromosome assembly available on NCBI, using ragtag (v1.1.1) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1829-6].

RepeatModeler (v2.0.1) [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1921046117] and RepeatMasker (v4.1.1) [@repeatmasker] were used to create a species-specific repeat database, and mask those repeats in the genome.
All available RNA-seq libraries for *L. rohita* [@tbl:rnaseq] were downloaded from NCBI and mapped to the masked genome using hisat2 (v2.1.0) [@doi:10.1038/s41587-019-0201-4].
These alignments were used in the mikado (v2.0rc2) [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy093] and braker2 (v2.1.5) [@doi:10.1093/nargab/lqaa108] pipelines.
Mikado uses the putative transcripts assembled from the RNA-seq alignments using stringtie (v2.1.2) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1910-1], cufflinks (v2.2.1) [@doi:10.1038/nprot.2012.016], and trinity (v2.11.0) [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1883]; along with the junction site prediction from portcullis (v1.2.2) [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy131 ], the alignments of the putative transcripts with UniprotKB Swiss-Prot (v2021.03) [@uniprot], and the ORFs from prodigal (v2.6.3) [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-119] to select the best representative for each locus.
Braker2 uses the RNA-seq alignments and the gene prediction from GeneMark-ES (v4.61) [@doi:10.1002/0471250953.bi0406s35] to train a species-specific Augustus (v3.3.3) [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-7-62] model.
Maker2 (v2.31.10) [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-491] predicts genes based on the new Augustus, GeneMark, and SNAP models; modifying the predictions based on the available RNA and protein evidence from the *Cyprinidae* family in the NCBI RefSeq database.
Any predicted genes with an AED above 0.47 were removed from further analysis.
The surviving genes were functionally annotated using InterProScan (v5.47-82.0) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu031] and BLAST+ (v2.9.0) [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-421] alignments against the UniprotKB Swiss-Prot database.
Busco (v5.2.2) [@doi:10.1093/molbev/msab199] was used to verify the completeness of both the genome and annotations against the actinopterygii_odb10 database.
